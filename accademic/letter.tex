\maketitle

I constantly want to challenge myself with difficulties. I want to understand if i can be part of something bigger than me. It was the first thing which motivated me doing the PhD in Computer Graphics, where the main objective was publishing a main author paper at SIGGRAPH. I think in the difficulties it's much more funny to share knowledge, and being a group. 

. I love sharing thoughts and knowledge with the team, because i'm constantly pushed by the desire to learn.

No space for one men armies. 

I truly believe in the discipline when working on a project. It it needs to be done, it must be done. I don't believe in the perfect order of things which must be followed from the start to the end in the supposed amount of time. When doing something new and challenging there's always the possibility of unexpected problems, and i love to put my head in those situations.
